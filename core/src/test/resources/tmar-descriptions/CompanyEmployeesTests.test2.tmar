Company employees (with specific entity ids)

_THIS TEST IS THE SAME AS TEST1 BUT IS IMPORTING DATA IN 3 STEPS

//TODO: Import the parent test !

The purpose of this test is to insert some master data and to check that datas are 
correctly created. 
 
Here are the master data to insert :
/include  MasterDataA

First of all, let's check that table contains the appropriate number of lines :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | size ? |
 | COUNT     | Employee   | 6      |
 | COUNT     | City       | 3      |
 | COUNT     | Team       | 4      |
 | COUNT     | Company    | 1      |
 | COUNT     | Department | 2      |
NB : events are also automatically created when employees are created, then we should have the same result :
 | COUNT     | Event      | 6      |

Now let's that some objects are found :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | exists ? |    
 | EXISTS    | City       | 92150      | true     |    
 | EXISTS    | Team       | IT-001     | true     |    
 | EXISTS    | Company    | CO0        | true     |    
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | 2256725396 | true     |    
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | Trilili    | false    |    

Let's check that fields are correctly set according to master data :
 /sequence 
 [ operation | 
 | CHECK     | 
 | CHECK     | 
 | CHECK     |

  /sequence

Company employees (using multi-field references + using jspresso keys)

//TODO: Import the parent test !

The purpose of this test is to insert some master data and to check that datas are 
correctly created. 
 
Here are the master data to insert :
/include  MasterDataD

First of all, let's check that table contains the appropriate number of lines :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | size ? |  
 | COUNT     | Company    | 1      |  
 | COUNT     | Department | 2      |  
 | COUNT     | Employee   | 4      |  
This example do not use all tables :
 | COUNT     | City       | 0      |  
 | COUNT     | Team       | 0      |  
NB : events are also automatically created when employees are created, then we should have the same result :
 | COUNT     | Event      | 4      |  

Now let's that some objects are found :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | exists ? | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | 2256725396 | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | Trilili    | false    | 

Let's check that fields are correctly set according to master data :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | field          | value ?                | 
 | CHECK     | Employee   | 2256725396 | name           | Berlutti               | 
 | CHECK     | Employee   | 2256725396 | company.name   | Design2See             |

Company employees (one step data import)

The purpose of this test is to insert some master data and to check that datas are 
correctly created. 

Here are the master data to insert :
/include  MasterDataA 
Important : import all data in one step !

First of all, let's check that table contains the appropriate number of lines :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | size ? |  
 | COUNT     | Employee   | 6      |  
 | COUNT     | City       | 3      |  
 | COUNT     | Team       | 4      |  
 | COUNT     | Company    | 1      |  
 | COUNT     | Department | 2      |  
NB : events are also automatically created when employees are created, then we should have the same result :
 | COUNT     | Event      | 6      |  

Now let's that some objects are found :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | exists ? | 
 | EXISTS    | City       | 92150      | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Team       | IT-001     | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Company    | CO0        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | 2256725396 | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | Trilili    | false    | 

Let's check that fields are correctly set according to master data :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | field           | value ?                  | 
 | CHECK     | City       | 75001      | name            | Paris I                  | 
 | CHECK     | Company    | CO0        | contact.address | 123 avenue de la Liberté | 
 | CHECK     | Employee   | 2256725396 | contact.address | 104 square des Bégonias  |

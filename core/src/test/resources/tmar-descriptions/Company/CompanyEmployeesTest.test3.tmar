Company employees (without specific entity ids)

_THIS TEST IS THE SAME AS TEST2 BUT WITHOUT FORCED ENTITY IDS

//TODO: Import the parent test !

The purpose of this test is to insert some master data and to check that datas are 
correctly created. 
 
Here are the master data to insert :
/include  MasterDataB

First of all, let's check that table contains the appropriate number of lines :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | size ? |  
 | COUNT     | Employee   | 6      |  
 | COUNT     | City       | 3      |  
 | COUNT     | Team       | 4      |  
 | COUNT     | Company    | 1      |  
 | COUNT     | Department | 2      |

 NB : events are also automatically created when employees are created, then we should have the same result :
 /inline
 When using [ operation ] COUNT |
 on [ table name ] Employee |
 then [ size ? ] 6 | of course !

Now let's that some objects are found :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | exists ? | 
 | EXISTS    | City       | CI1        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Team       | TE1        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Company    | CO0        | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | 2256725396 | true     | 
 | EXISTS    | Employee   | Trilili    | false    | 

Let's check that fields are correctly set according to master data :
 /sequence
 [ operation | table name | key value  | field           | value ?                  | 
 | CHECK     | City       | CI1        | name            | Paris I                  | 
 | CHECK     | Company    | CO0        | contact.address | 123 avenue de la Liberté | 
 | CHECK     | Employee   | 2256725396 | contact.address | 104 square des Bégonias  |
